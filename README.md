# Chatbot app using GPT with Retrieval Augmented Generation

This repository contains a basic adaptable Python application designed to work with custom data & OpenAI's GPT models.
Utilizing the LangChain library for LLM access & processing PDF files and, Streamlit for creating a self-hosted web app 
chat interface, this project enables enhanced interaction with AI models by supporting the retrieval-augmented generation
concept.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines the generative capabilities of models like GPT with 
a retrieval component. This approach allows the model to pull in relevant information from a dataset (in this case, PDF 
documents) at runtime, leading to outputs that are informed by a broader context than the model's pre-trained knowledge.


## Features

- **Custom Data Processing**: Process PDF files to use as custom data for GPT model inference.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Enhance GPT model responses by integrating retrieval from custom data sources.
- **Streamlit Web App**: Interact with the OpenAI's GPT model through a user-friendly chat interface hosted on your own server.
- **OpenAI API Integration**: Seamlessly use OpenAI's API with your own API key for model access.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later.
- An active OpenAI API key.
